# 🚀 Quick Start - Email OTP Verification

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your **email verification with OTP** is now fully functional! Here's what happens when a user signs up:

1. **User fills signup form** → System sends 6-digit OTP to their email
2. **User enters OTP** → System verifies the code
3. **If valid** → Account is created and user is logged in
4. **If invalid** → Error shown, user can try again (max 5 attempts)
