### ☑️ Do You Have These Ready?

   - Get it from: [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
   - ⚠️ Make sure network access allows `0.0.0.0/0`

2. **JWT Secret** (32+ characters)
   - Generate with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
   - Or use any strong random string

3. **Vercel Account** (Free)
   - Sign up: [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)

### ✅ If you have all three → You're ready to deploy!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Features That Won't Work on Vercel:

1. **Socket.IO** (Real-time notifications)
   - Won't work in serverless environment
   - **Solution**: Deploy separately on Railway/Render/Heroku

2. **Scheduled Tasks** (Discount lifecycle service)
   - Background tasks don't run continuously
   - **Solution**: Use Vercel Cron Jobs (Pro plan) or external service

3. **Large File Uploads** (>4.5MB)
   - Vercel payload size limit
   - **Solution**: Use Vercel Blob Storage or AWS S3

### Don't Worry!
- These are optional features
- Your main app will work perfectly
- Solutions are available if you need these features later

---

## 🆘 Quick Help

### ❌ Database Connection Failed?
→ Check MongoDB Atlas allows connections from `0.0.0.0/0`

### ❌ CORS Errors?
→ Add your frontend URL to `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable

### ❌ 500 Internal Server Error?
→ Run `vercel logs` to see what went wrong

### ❌ Can't Find Something?
→ All guides are in the `server/` directory
